<p>
<b>Be Specific</b> – Exactly what do you want to achieve? Create sub-goals to your overall goal and address who, what, when, where and why. Use action verbs within your goals (i.e., Create, Design, Develop, Implement, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Make It Measureable</b> – Ensure you can track the progress and measure the outcome.</p>
<p><b>Achievable</b> – Your goals should be within your control where you can attain them. Vague (“Boiling the Ocean”) and unattainable goals may lead to disappointment.</p>
<p><b>Realistic</b> – Make sure what you are trying to achieve is practical and relevant. Review and update your goals as needed.</p>
<p><b>Timeline</b> – A goal should be grounded within a time frame. If you want to lose 10 pounds, by when do you want to achieve this goal?
